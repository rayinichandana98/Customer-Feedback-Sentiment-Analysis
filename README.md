Built an automated tool which pulls tweets (either by crawling web or manual input of tweets/posts on social media) and it performs sentiment analysis to give if the feedback is positive, negative or neutral on a product of the company or individual using Random forest Classifier.

Sometimes known as “opinion mining,” sentiment analysis can let you know if there has been a change in public opinion toward any aspect of your business. Peaks or valleys in sentiment scores give you a place to start if you want to make product improvements, train sales or customer care agents, or create new marketing campaigns.

Languages and Modules Used:
Python - Numpy, Pandas, Tweepy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Beautiful Soup, Collections, RE, Flask, Highcharts.
